# Speechcatcher

Speechcatcher is a open source toolbox for transcribing and translating speech from media files (audio/video).

## Models


## Data

Scripts to replicate the data gathering can be found in: <a href="https://github.com/speechcatcher-asr/speechcatcher-data-de">speechcatcher-data-de</a>.

## Webgui

Speechcatcher also comes with an easy to use <a href="https://github.com/speechcatcher-asr/speechcatcher-webgui">webgui</a>. It is going to support multiple ASR engines: <a href="https://github.com/speechcatcher-asr/speechcatcher">speechcatcher (GPU/CPU)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/uhh-lt/subtitle2go">subtitle2go (CPU-only)</a> or <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">whisper (GPU)</a>.  

## Benchmarks

By using models that target a single language, Speechcatcher models aim to be much faster than single-model transcribe systems for multiple languages such as <a href="https://github.com/openai/whisper">whisper</a>.

Currently the focus is on transcribing German speech. Later, more languages might be added. If you would like to help to expand Speechcatcher, please get in touch!
